# IBP

This is the Matlab package for the paper "Posterior Contraction Rate of Sparse Latent Feature Models with Application to Proteomics".

run.m is the main file to execute the Parallel Tempering MCMC algorithm. 
The data file is in .csv format with n rows and p columns.

The other .m files are functions for running the Parallel Tempering MCMC algorithm.

X.csv is the RPPA data. It is n*p dimensional. n = 157 and p = 100.
